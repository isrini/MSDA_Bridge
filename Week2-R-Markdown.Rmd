This is an R Markdown document. 

The task here is to write a custom variation of the choose() function, that does not use factorial or choose functions from R library.

        R choose Function

choose() function computes the combination nCr.
```
choose(n,r)

n: n elements
r: r subset elements
...
nCr = n!/(r! * (n-r)!) 
> choose(5,2)
[1] 10
```

      Here is the custom code to compute 5c3 without using libarary functions

```
fact <- function(x){
  y <- 1
  for(i in 1:x){
    y <- y*((1:x)[i])
  }
print(y)
}

a <- 5
b <- 3

sol <- fact(a)/(fact(a-b) * fact(b))
```

sol
[1] 10

    The answer is 10
